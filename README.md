# Meshfinity

Meshfinity uses TripoSR to generate 3D meshes based on 2D reference images. A [pre-built, ready-to-use version is available now for macOS](https://github.com/meshfinity/meshfinity/releases), and we're hoping to get the Windows build working soon.

## Setup (macOS)

- Download the macOS build from [Releases](https://github.com/meshfinity/meshfinity/releases) page.
- Since the macOS version is not notarized, you'll need to *right-click* (or *Control-click*) the Meshfinity application in Finder and click **Open**. When prompted that macOS could not verify the application, open the **Settings** app, navigate to the **Privacy & Security** section, then scroll all the way down and click the **Open Anyway** button. *(If you are concerned that this application is malicious, feel free to verify it with https://virustotal.com or your preferred anti-malware tool).*
